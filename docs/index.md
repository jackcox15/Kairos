# Kairos: Communication That Can't Be Shut Down Easily
---

## What Is KAIROS?

KAIROS is a **community owned and operated communication network** that works independently of big tech, internet service providers, and government infrastructure.

Think of it as creating your own internet,  one that:
- **Can't be censored** or shut down by corporations or governments
- **Works without the internet** using long-range radio technology (RNodes/LoRa)
- **Costs almost nothing** to run once deployed
- **Belongs to your community**, not to any company

It's built for mutual aid groups, organizers, journalists, and communities who need reliable communication.

## Why Does This Matter?

**The Problem:**
- Internet can be shut down during protests or disasters
- Platforms ban users and delete communities without warning
- Survelliance Capitalism is emerging 
- Emergency services fail exactly when you need them most

**The Solution:**
Kairos gives communities the tools to communicate on their own terms, using technology they control,
While keeping it moderately it simple.

## How It Works

Kairos combines three layers that work together:

### Layer 1: Global Network (Optional)
When you have internet, Kairos connects everyone worldwide through secure encrypted tunnels over securely owned VPS architecture.
Your messages reach other Kairos users anywhere on Earth using secure VPN tunnels. 

### Layer 2: Local Radio Mesh
Small radio devices create a local network in your city or neighborhood, no internet required. These radios can reach 1-20+ miles depending on setup.
Radios help facilitate local network traffic, allow new pathways for communication to flow. 

### Layer 3: Direct Communication
Even if everything else fails, two people with Kairos devices can message each other directly through radio waves. 

**The Magic:** If the internet goes down, KAIROS automatically keeps working using just the radio layer. Your local community can still communicate.

**For Community Members:**
- Plug in a USB stick or SD card → instant secure messaging
      Or run the "deploy_rns" script on current PC 
- Web interface that feels like any chat app
- Works on cheap used computers ($30-$50)

**For Community Tech People:**
- Step-by-step setup guides
- Pre-configured system images
- Automated hardware configuration tools
- Network monitoring and status displays

**For Everyone:**
- End-to-end encrypted by default
- No phone numbers or real names required
- Community bulletin boards and file sharing
- Offline first design that gracefully handles failures

## The Technology (Explained Simply)

Kairos isn't built from scratch, it combines proven open-source tools:

- **Reticulum**: The core networking protocol (think: the postal service for encrypted messages)
- **LoRa Radio**: Long-range, low-power radio communication (like walkie-talkies, but 20+ miles)
- **MeshChat**: The familiar messaging interface you actually use
- **WireGuard**: Secure internet tunnels when you have connectivity

Everything is **free, open-source, and community-audited**.

## Our Principles

### 1. Community Ownership
You own the hardware. You control the network. No company can take it away or charge you later.

### 2. Privacy First
Messages are encrypted end-to-end. Your identity isn't tied to phone numbers, emails, or government IDs.

### 3. Resilience Over Convenience
The network keeps working even when parts fail. Local communication survives even if global infrastructure collapses.

### 4. Mutual Aid, Not Profit
This isn't a product sold to consumers. It's infrastructure shared freely among communities who need it.

### 5. Accessible Technology
Non-technical people can use it. But if you want to understand how it works, everything is documented and open.

## Getting Started

Kairos grows through trusted networks, not mass marketing.

**If you're part of:**
- Mutual aid organizations
- Community organizing groups
- Neighborhood resilience networks
- Independent journalism projects
- Privacy and digital rights communities
- Hackerspaces / Makerspaces 

**...and this resonates with you**, we want to connect.

## Who We Are

Kairos is **systems integration work**  we don't invent new technology, we make existing tools accessible to communities who need them.

Core technologies developed by:
- **Mark Qvist** - Reticulum Network Stack, RNode hardware, LXMF
- **Liam Cottle** - MeshChat web interface

KAIROS integrates these into deployable systems with:
- Automated setup scripts
- Hardware configuration tools
- User friendly interfaces
- Community documentation

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this legal?**
Yes. Using LoRa radios on the appropriate frequencies is legal in most countries (915MHz in North America, 868MHz in Europe). 
Always check your local regulations!

**How much does it cost?**
- USB deployment on existing hardware: Free
- Basic radio setup: $30-50 for used hardware
- Full node with custom box: $50-$200 depending on parts

**Do I need internet?**
Kairos works with or without internet. Internet connectivity enables global reach, but local communication works independently.
Joining the Kairos Network is optional, you can always connect your own VPN, Tor, I2P, or any other globally reaching interface! 

**How many people can use it?**
KAIROS scales from 2 people to city-wide networks to global mesh. The Reticulum protocol is designed for networks of thousands of nodes, supporting millions.

## A Final Note

This isn't about technology for technology's sake.

Kairos exists because **communities need to communicate**, especially during moments when communication becomes most difficult, and most critical.

When platforms silence voices, when infrastructure fails, when surveillance becomes oppression, having control over your own communication becomes an act of resistance and resilience.

We're building tools for that future, together.
